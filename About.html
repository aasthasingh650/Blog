		<p> 
			I am a 1st year undergraduate at IIIT-Allahabad, a beginner at competitive programmer and web development, a movie and and series lover in the era of virtual games, and quite socially active bird pursuing B.Tech with Information Technology.
		</p></br>
		<h3> School Days </h3>
		<p> 
			I was not the so-fun-loving student during late years of school, or can say that I was more busy at focusing on how much marks do I get after mugging up the whole syllabus. And probably that's why didn't had so many friends at school. Organic chemistry in intermediate has been the most dreadful suject of all time for me.</p>
		<h3> Drop Year </h3>
		<p>
			Ah! The real painful struggling year. Never had spent so many hours at the study table(Am I the person now? I hardly believe it). Didn't make any friends this year. So much into fixed shcedule and my life with key-pad phone. No good experience to share from this part of life.

		<div class="div1"><h3> College Life(Life @IIIT-Allahabad)</h3>
		<p>
			Alas same city! Experience as a 1st Year- Sadly half of the 1st year was spent at home(due to COVID-19). Met really nice people here and became friends with them. 1st semester just went vague in looking out for my interest in a particular tech field. Being volunteer in lots of campus acitvites had been a realy tiring experience. Not going in that again.

		<h2> Hobby and Interests </h2>
		<h3> Love for animals </h3>
		<p>
			I have a pet, named Plato(a German Shepherd), living at my home with us since 2013. The love for her has kept only growing with the time. Apart from this, all animals are lovely and attractive for me.
		</p>

		<h3> Fitness </h3>
		<p> 
			I have always been concerned about my fitness, and after starting Yoga and exercises since 9th standard, my seriousness towards my health and fitness has always remained one of the top priorities. This interest was facilitated when I joined college which has a gym here. Workout is lob.
		</p>
		<h3> Food </h3>
		<p>
			I didn't know almost anything about cooking till the lockdown of COVID-19, earlier eating was the only hobby in this area(xD). FYI, You tube(yes! not mommy, nor granny) has taught me a lot so far about cooking.
		</p>
		<h3> Swimming </h3>

		<p>
			Just had 2 or months practice in water but I am quite desperate to learn swimming. Pool at college is a lovely opportunity to do this.
		</p>

		<h2> Favourite series and TV Shows </h2>
		<h3> GOT(Game of thrones) </h3>
		<img id="img2" src="GOT.jpg">
		<p>
			This tops the list. A thrilling and captivating show, which finally came to an end in May,2019. Yes,you guessed it right, this was the month of JEE advanced for me. The social media was overflowing with reviews of this show and everywhere the same chaos of responses of un-satisfied viewers(I was also one of them). This obviously proved to have an adverse effect on my studies. See this is where the trouble began(xD my present institute).
		</p>
		<h3> F.R.I.E.N.D.S </h3>
		<img id="img3" src="friends.jpg"
		<p>
			People who watch friends, watch only friends. Yess, I am one of those, who dislike all the series watched after watching friends. The level of humour and the simplicity with which the actors performed the whole 10 seasons is indescribable.
		</p>
		<p>
			So yeah, the list is short(maybe I have watched very less shows), but no doubt that these 2 will remain love of all time for me.
		</p>

		<div class="div4">
		<h2> Books and Novels </h2>
		<p>
			Grew up reading course recommended novels of David Dickens and other proficient writers who caught my interest in reading at the age of 9-10. In later years of school(life before PCM) Chetan Bhagat became favourite author(yeah nice shift in interest lol). Now it's been many years without novels. And I think I ahve lost that love for books:(
